#Test your recon and phishing skills in order to complete your objective.

## Task Description:

Task 1: You are a penetration tester who has recently been requested to perform a security assessment for Brik. You are permitted to perform active assessments on MACHINE_IP and strictly passive reconnaissance on brownbrick.co. The scope includes only the domain and IP provided and does not include other TLDs.
To begin, start the Virtual Machine by pressing the Start Machine button at the top of this task. You may access the VM using the AttackBox or your VPN connection. Please allow 3â€“4 minutes for the VM to fully boot up.

No Answer Needed

Task 2:

Conquer the machine and submit the flags below.

What is the user flag?

What is the password of the user wrohit?

What is the password to access the hMailServer Administrator Dashboard?


## Reconnaissance:

I began with active reconnaissance to gather information about the running services on my target using Nmap and Rustscan.

```console
rustscan -a <VICTIM_IP>
nmap -sS -sC -sV <victim_IP> -p- >> results
```

I discovered several interesting services, including RDP and SMB, that were active on the targetâ€™s machine. To gain access to RDP, I needed credentials, so I conducted passive reconnaissance on the targetâ€™s domain to search for exposed usernames or passwords.

While I was unable to find any passwords, I did manage to identify some usernames, and I saved in a file for use in a dictionary attack against the RDP port.

```
cat >> usernames

oaurelius
wrohit
lhedvig
tchikondi
pcathrine
fstamatis
```
## Dictionary attack

Next, I launched Hydra to perform the dictionary attack.

![screenshot4](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*XwGtm9nkwByrOXQ7FcNalA.png)

```console
hydra -t 1 -l username -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rdp://victim_IP
```

After successfully obtaining the credentials, I attempted to enumerate SMB shares using the following command.

## Enumeration SMB 

![screenshot5](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*E2QLq1GtNeaSOjihy6T5lg.png)

```console
smbclient -L //10.10.154.252 -U user
```
With the hacked credentials, I connected to the targetâ€™s RDP and retrieved the first flag.

## Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ACCESS

![screenshot6](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*YvmdNXB2EE-6UZCF4RRRFw.png)

Once connected, I proceeded to enumerate other users on the victim machine. During this process, I found the database of hMailServer and gained access to all user hashes.

## ENUMERATION AND HASHES (END)

![screenshot10](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*bi2QwogVWf2SNdXx2E_GsQ.png)

In the final steps, I cracked the hash of the Administrator account and answered the last question of the challenge.
