The purpose of this challenge is to make use of more realistic techniques and include them into a single machine to practice your skills.

`Difficulty: Medium`

`Web Language: PHP`

﻿ => ﻿You will have to add a machine IP with domain vulnnet.thm to your `/etc/hosts`

```console
echo "10.10.96.163  vulnnet.thm" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

```

Then we have confirmed it by typing `ping` to the `vulnnet.thm` domain on the terminal.

## Enumeration

Rustscan scan reveals open ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP)

After running a directory brute‑force scan against `http://vulnnet.thm`, the following directories and files were discovered:

![dir-brute-force1](/images/tryhackme-Vulnnet/dir-bruteforce.jpg)

![dir-brute-force12](/images/tryhackme-Vulnnet/dir-bruteforce2.jpg)

Notably, the main discovery that did appear was an LFI vector via `index.php?referer=…`, rather than other directories

Accessing `/etc/passwd` through the LFI confirmed two user accounts on the machine. They are `root` and `server-management`.

## Extracting Credentials via LFI

 accessed the `.htpasswd` file located at `/etc/apache2/.htpasswd`

## Hash Cracking

The hash uses the Apache MD5 ($apr1$) format. To crack the password, we saved the hash and used John the Ripper with the rockyou.txt wordlist:

After cracking the developers credentials, we attempted to access the SSH service. However, this failed and browsed to the login page, but the credentials did not work there either. At this point, we suspected that the credentials might be intended for a different virtual host. To investigate further, we performed virtual host (vhost) enumeration using a common wordlist.

This revealed multiple subdomains, including:

`broadcast.vulnnet.thm`

When visiting `http://broadcast.vulnnet.thm`, we encountered an HTTP Basic Authentication prompt.

we entered the previously discovered credentials:

Landing on the main page, you detect the app is ClipBucket 4.0

## ClipBucket Exploit

After identifying that the target was running `ClipBucket v4.0`, we discovered that it was vulnerable to a known remote code execution. Using msfconsole, we loaded the appropriate module and successfully gained a reverse shell as the `www-data` user.

Once we had shell access, we began enumerating files and directories. While exploring the system, we found a backup file then downloaded the file to our local machine using `python3 -m http.server` and `wget` on the target.

`/home/server-management/ssh-backup.tar.gz`

The archive contained a private SSH key `(id_rsa)`. To crack it, we used `ssh2john` and `john`:

While enumerating the system as server-management, we discovered a cron job running as root. This script was configured to run every 2 minutes, and its purpose was to create a tar archive of the `/home/server-management/Documents` directory.

## Privilege Escalation

We run this command inside Documents directory then checked for a root flag from `/tmp ` directory.

```console
echo "cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/flag.txt" > shell.sh
```
