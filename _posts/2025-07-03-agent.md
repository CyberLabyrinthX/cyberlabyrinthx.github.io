Agent Sudo Tryhackme challenge - [click here to access the challenge](https://tryhackme.com/room/agentsudoctf)

üß∞ Tools to Keep Ready:

nmap, burpsuite, rustscan, ffuf, steghide, binwalk, fcrackzip, hydra, john, and linpeas.sh.

üéØ Steps to reveal the truth :

Initial Recon and Port Scanning

Web Enumeration

Steganography

Hash Cracking and Brute Force attacks

Hack the shell

Privilege Escalation.

## Enumerate the machine and get all the important information

I used a Rustscan tool in this challenge. [RustScan quickly finds open ports, then hands those off to nmap for version detection, service enumeration and others. You can learn more about this tool here.](https://tryhackme.com/room/rustscan)

## Initial Recon and Port Scanning:

We use Rustscan or nmap to understand what is happening on a network. It helps us to see what devices are connected, finding open ports on those devices, which tells us what services like web servers, FTP, SSH are running then we check for security vulnerabilities, such as outdated software or unnecessary services that could be exploited.

![nmap-results](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*lO-lwrAHCDW2L_itxMCyqg.png)

```console
rustscan -a ip_addr
```

## Open ports:

üîí Port 21 (FTP ‚Äî File Transfer Protocol) ‚Äî It is used for ransferring files.

üîí Port 22 (SSH ‚Äî Secure Shell) ‚Äî It is used for remote command line access.

üåê Port 80 (HTTP ‚Äî Web Server) ‚Äî It is used to serve web pages over the internet.

After finding an open web port, usually port 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS , we want to enumerate and analyze the web service to identify potential entry points or vulnerabilities like this

## Web Enumeration

![web-enum1](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*D2CjVyajWy0imCo9ITPQ2A.jpeg)

The website is behaving differently based on the User-Agent header, and that behavior has revealed hidden content and it is a username. That‚Äôs a classic case of security through obscurity.

![web-enum2](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*BnKAIWQBvSqRNPR_W0wtOA.jpeg)


Done enumerate the machine? Time to brute your way out.


## FTP -BRUTE_FORCE_ATTACK

The next step is attacking to the FTP by brute forcing the passwords for that username. We can use a brute force tool such as Hydra or Medusa to automate login attempts against the FTP service on port 21.

![ftp-bruteforce](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*WYUD3o9-IarDSTJBp_0dRQ.jpeg)

```console

hydra -l [redacted-username] -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://ipv4
```

## FTP ‚Äî Data exfiltration

![data-exfilFTP](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*Cx8_r2zvLwGMSvHmpiBdJA.jpeg)


After downloading files, checked for embedded hidden data from files using steghide and binwalk. The binwalk helped me to find a hidden zip file. There are several tools commonly used to find embedded data in files. I use the binwalk to scan for for embedded files, compressed archives, and things like this but I use the steghide to scan for embedded texts and strings.

## Hash Cracking (zip password)

![zip-password](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*sVyFYzuEnrc9e6h7qulPEg.jpeg)

```console
ssh2john 8702.zip > hash.txt
```

```console
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
```


## steg password

![steg-password](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*841v_znggUSzKS1bnky4SQ.jpeg)

Who is the other agent (in full name)?

So, retrieved the steganography password, used it to extract hidden data and found a secret message.txt file containing hidden passwords and other agent full name.

You know the drill.
What is the user flag?

## OSINT

What is the incident of the photo called? (OSINT)

To find the name of the incident, i used a google image search to find the answer to the question.

## CVE-2019-14287

Enough with the extraordinary stuff? Time to get real.

CVE number for the escalation

(Format: CVE-xxxx-xxxx)

What is the root flag?

We check for SUID bit set files after gaining access to a victim machine because they can be a path to privilege escalation and especially to root access. This time, there is a vulnerability that allows users with limited sudo permissions to bypass restrictions by specifying the user ID -1 which some systems treat as root (UID 0). It affects sudo versions prior to 1.8.28.

(Bonus) Who is Agent R?

The Agent R is DesKel. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
