Cowboy hacker is an easy and walkthrough type room with a lot of hints.

Steps:
-	First we run the machine, and boot it up to get the IP.
-	Then we scan the ports, and we see there‚Äôs a port 80, 22 and 21.

[Now I didn‚Äôt bother checking HTTP, just because in this case we already got the big fish from the FTP port. But its always a good idea to check the HTTP port.]

-	Then we log in into the FTP port with username anonymous, and as soon as we enter we get into the problem of the server going into Extended Passive Mode.

We work around this by using the command passive and hit enter.

Next we use the command ls and we see two files

		-> tasks.txt
		-> locks.txt

The tasks.txt has the username to one of the users in the machine.
While the locks.txt seems to be a list of passwords, which very possibly could be SSH.
`[Spoiler Alert: It was üòè]`


-	Next we use hydra to bruteforce our way into the machine.
```console
ssh -l target_username -P locks.txt ssh://TARGET_IP
```

-	Then BAM !!! We found a password. Once we log in, the users flag is right in the home directory waiting for us.

Next, we see what the user lin can run with sudo, and then we see the pretty vulnerable `tar` binary. 

![sudo](/images/tryhackme-cowboy-hacker/image4.jpg)

Now while the `/bin/tar` program here isn‚Äôt really a SUID binary, since it can be run as root for lin, we can still use [GTFO bins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/#sudo) and find a way to exploit this.

And that‚Äôs it, tar seems to have an argument that can allow you to run a ‚Äúcheckpoint-action‚Äù code after a certain checkpoint number, which I assume is the number of files processed after which the `‚Äúcheckpoint-action‚Äù` is run.

Once you run that, you get a the dreaded `ROOT SHELL üò≥`

The root.txt flag will be waiting for you !
