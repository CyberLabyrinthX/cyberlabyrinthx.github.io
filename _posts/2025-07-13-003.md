## Task briefing:

In April 2017 Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo, the then president of Somalia, visited Turkey. A news agency published a photo where he was seen shaking hands with Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the country‚Äôs president. The article did not disclose where the photo was taken. 

Our task is to find out the name and coordinates of [the location seen below](https://gralhix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/osint-exercise-003-picture.jpg).

After noticing the circular emblem above the entrance, I conducted a Google search and discovered it to be the Turkish Presidential Seal, which indicated that the image was taken at the Presidential Complex.

I used Google Maps to search for the 'Presidential Complex of Turkey in Ankara' and obtain its location coordinates.

After obtaining the coordinates `39.930961, 32.799044`, I used Google Earth Pro to pinpoint the exact location.

This exercise reinforced how small visual details such as signs, emblems, and architectural features can play a significant role in geolocation tasks within OSINT. Noticing the Turkish Presidential Seal above the entrance allowed me to narrow down the location quickly and accurately.
